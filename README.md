# Machine Learning

> Machine Learning excercises from the Coursera [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course from Stanford University.

All of the excercises are actually part of the assignments that you get during the course. Before diving in, if you are following the course, try to write your own implementation before you see how it has been implemented here.

The contents of this repo by week:
* [Week 2](src/ex1/ex1.pdf) - Linear Regression
* [Week 3](src/ex2/ex2.pdf) - Logistic Regression
* [Week 4](src/ex3/ex3.pdf) - Multiclass Classification & Neural Networks: Classification
* [Week 5](src/ex4/ex4.pdf) - Neural Networks: Learning
* [Week 6](src/ex5/ex5.pdf) - Neural Networks: Regularization, Bias vs. Variance


### Octave
----------
All the exercises are written in [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/v4.0.1), a free alternative to Matlab.
Check out the install instructions:
* [OS X](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_MacOS_X)
* [Windows](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows)
* [Linux](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_GNU/Linux)


### Credits
-----------
It's to be noted that parts of the implementations have been borrowed from [Swizec Teller](https://github.com/Swizec).
